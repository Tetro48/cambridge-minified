Cambridge
=========

Welcome to Cambridge, the next open-source falling-block game engine!

The project is written and maintained exclusively by [Milla](https://github.com/MillaBasset), [joezeng](https://github.com/joezeng) and [Oshisaure](https://github.com/oshisaure)!

The Discord server has been reopened! https://discord.gg/AADZUmgsph

The game also has a website now with more detail than seen on this README: https://t-sp.in/cambridge

Playing the game
----------------

### Windows

You do not need LÖVE on Windows, as it comes bundled with the program.

#### Stable release

To get the stable release, simply download either `cambridge_windows_x86.zip` (32-bit, x86) or `cambridge_windows_x64.zip` (64-bit, x86-64) in the [latest release](../../releases/latest).

All assets needed are bundled with the executable.

#### Bleeding edge

If you want the bleeding edge version, download [this](../../archive/master.zip). Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choosing.

If you're on Windows, you can double-click `start.bat` to run the game. If that doesn't work, open a Command Prompt where you extracted Cambridge and run:

	dist\windows\love.exe .

If that doesn't work, run this instead, still using Command Prompt where you extracted Cambridge:

	dist\win32\love.exe .

Then, check the mod pack section at the bottom of this page.

### macOS, Linux

If you haven't already, install `love` with your favourite package manager (Homebrew on macOS, your system's default on Linux). **Make sure you're using LÖVE 11.3, because it won't work with earlier or later versions!**

#### Downloading a release

You can download the .love file in the latest release, and run it with:

    love cambridge.love

#### Installing from source

Clone the repository in git:

	git clone https://github.com/MillaBasset/cambridge

Alternatively, download the source code ZIP in the latest release.

Then, navigate to the root directory that you just cloned, and type:

	love .

It should run automatically!


## Notes for Flooding edge

This fork might have weird bugs that isn't addressed by [Tetro48](https://github.com/Tetro48/); it has a lot of changes.
e.g.
Mouse controls, cursor type, visual settings, separate audio settings, dedicated highscores viewer, replay tree, replay speed, tool-assisted speedrun mode, input re-work, replay tunings (although that'd be helpful), file drag-n-drop, and many many more.

Any bugs found here that does not also apply to vanilla version must only be reported on this fork. Do not make issues related to this fork on [the fork's origin](https://github.com/MillaBasset/cambridge).
